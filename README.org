* Kiwi ü•ù

Kiwi is a little programming language. It is dynamically typed and interpreted.

[[https://kiwi.frankpf.com][Try it on the Kiwi playground!]]

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
fun fib(n) {
   if n < 2 {
	n
   } else {
	fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
   }
}

print "Calculating fib(15)"
print fib(15)
#+END_SRC

** Status
  
The Kiwi VM supports expressions, basic types (~Boolean~, ~String~, ~Double~ and
~Integer~) and local variables.
  
I've worked through some iterations of Kiwi, and they're in different branches:

- [[https://github.com/frankpf/kiwi/tree/main][main]]: Version currently being worked on. Dynamically typed, interpreted and
  meant to eventually have a JIT. The VM is written in Nim and the
  parser/scanner are written in TypeScript.
  
- [[https://github.com/frankpf/kiwi/tree/llvm][llvm]]: Version I worked in the past and am still experimenting with.
  Statically typed and compiled to native code with LLVM. It is far from
  finished; right now only floating point types are working (writing a type
  system is hard!) and there are expressions, if-else conditions and while
  loops.
